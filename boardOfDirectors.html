				The Board is the Club’s policy-setting and decision-making body in charge of enforcing the By-Laws, and it has the final say-so in Club matters pertaining to use of Club facilities and funds.  It consists of seven members who, before being elected to serve, must have attained at least eighteen months of total and continuous abstinence from alcohol or other mind-altering drug or participated continuously in Al-Anon, etc. for eighteen months.  The specific Board officers are listed in the Club By-Laws.  The Board’s Chair is responsible for convening, conducting, preserving order at, and adjourning meetings of the Board.  The Chair may establish committees comprised of Club members in good standing to assist in carrying out specific tasks.  The duties of the Chair and other officers of the Board may be modified by a majority vote of the Board.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Any Club member may be considered for election to the Board providing the person has paid Club dues for one year and has achieved eighteen months of continuous abstinence.  Election of new Board members is conducted after notice of elections has been posted in the Club facility and announced at the Club’s fellowship meetings thirty days before the election.  An elected Board member serves a two-year term of office but may continue to serve one or more additional terms if re-nominated and re-elected in accordance with the By-Laws.  If a vacancy occurs on the Board before a two-year term, the Board will appoint a replacement by a majority vote.  If the Board cannot agree on a replacement, a special election meeting of the membership will be held to elect a Club member to fill the vacancy.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The Board meets once each month.  A Board member who fails to attend two successive board meetings without justification will be automatically removed from the Board.  Other causes for removal from the Board are also stated in the By-Laws.
