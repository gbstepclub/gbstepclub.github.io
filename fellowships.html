				Below is a brief description of the twelve-step fellowships that presently offer meetings at the Club.  The fellowships’ websites provide more detailed information.

			<div class="my-text-section">
				<b>AA:</b> Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.  The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.  There are no dues or fees for AA membership; each AA group is self-supporting and declines outside contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes.  Its primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.  AA website: www.aa.org

			<div class="my-text-section">
				<b>ACA:</b> Adult Children Anonymous (formerly known as Adult Children of Alcoholics) is a twelve-step, twelve-tradition program of women and men who grew up in alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional homes.  The ACA groups discover how childhood affects the past and influences the present.  By practicing the twelve steps, focusing on the solution, and accepting a loving Higher Power of his or her own understanding, an individual finds freedom from the past and a way to improve present-day life.  The only requirement for membership is a desire to recover from the effects of growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.  ACA website: www.12stepforums.net/acoa.html; www.adultchildren.org
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div class="my-text-section">
				<b>CDA: </b> Chemically Dependent Anonymous is a twelve-step fellowship for anyone seeking freedom from drug and alcohol addiction.  CDA does not make distinctions in the recovery process based on any particular substance.  The basis of the program is abstinence from all mood-changing and mind-altering chemicals, including street-type drugs, alcohol, and unnecessary medication.  By sharing experience, strength, and hope with each other, CDA members solve their common problem and help others recover from chemical dependence that has made their lives unmanageable.  CDA is not affiliated with any political, religious, or commercial organizations or institutions.  CDA remains grateful to the co-founders and fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous for the twelve steps and twelve traditions, which are the basis of the program.  CDA website: www.cdaweb.org

			<br/>
			<div class="my-text-section">
				<b>DRA:</b> Dual Recovery Anonymous is a twelve-step fellowship of men and women who meet to support each other in their common recovery from the two illnesses that affect each member: an emotional or psychiatric illness and a chemical dependency on alcohol or drugs.  DRA helps people recover from these interrelated illnesses by focusing on relapse prevention and by actively improving the quality of life.  It provides a community of mutual support where members learn to avoid the risks that lead back to alcohol and drug use and how to reduce the symptoms of emotional or psychiatric illness.  The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using alcohol or other intoxicating drugs and to manage emotional and psychiatric illnesses in a healthy and constructive way.  DRA website: www.draonline.org

			<br/>
			<div class="my-text-section">
				<b>NA:</b> Narcotics Anonymous offers recovery from the effects of addiction through working a twelve-step program, including regular attendance at group meetings. The group atmosphere provides help from peers and offers an ongoing support network for addicts who wish to pursue and maintain a drug-free lifestyle.  The name, Narcotics Anonymous, is not meant to imply a focus on any particular drug; NA’s approach makes no distinction between drugs including alcohol.  Membership is free, and NA has no affiliation with any organizations outside of NA including governments, religions, law enforcement groups, or medical and psychiatric associations.  Through its service efforts and cooperation with others seeking to help addicts, NA strives to reach a day when every addict in the world has an opportunity to experience its message of recovery in his or her own language and culture.  NA website: www.na.org
